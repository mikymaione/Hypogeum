# Hypogeum
It's an open-source, online, multiplayer, game that we developed for the exam of Online Game Design. The game won the “Best multiplayer game” and “EDI special award” at New Game Designer 2019 in Milan (ngd.unimi.it).

## Introduction
Since humans had left the Earth, centuries have passed and the blue Planet is now inhabited only by the animals, that have learned to manage the technology of our descendants and to create their own. From that moment, a long war among the different species has taken act, to establish which was the best one. Inspired by the ancient books on “mythology”, they decided to set their battles in a huge arena: the Hypogeum. Rather than kill each other in “primitive” ways, they clashed each other using different cars, depending on the species they belong. Now, only four teams have left – Eagles, Lions, Rhinos and Sharks – and the outcome is more uncertain than ever. Who will be the audience’s favorite? Who will win the war? And, most important, who will obtain the supremacy?
